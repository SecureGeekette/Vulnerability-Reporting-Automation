Integrating personal Github repos repos for Snyk SAST/SCA/IaC scanning is super easy. When we create a personal Snyk account, Snyk will ask for an integration method to connect to code and run scans directly in our workflow. I chose my personal Github account. (We can only use a Snyk service account for Github enterprise integration)

After this, I gave Snyk access permissions to my public and private repos. After this we can enable specific checks such as Snyk Code (SAST), new pull request checks, dependency checks (SCA) etc.

After this we authorize Snyk to connect to Github

To understand how this integration works on a deeper level, I navigated to my personal Github account -> Settings -> Archives -> Security Log

1. Created a token for my user account for the Snyk OAuth app
2. Created authorization for OAuth application (Snyk) with read:org, repo, user:email scopes
3. Installed webhooks for individual repos/ projects with push, pull request events

What is a webhook?

A webhook is a mechanism that allows one system or application to send real-time data to another system or application as soon as a specific event occurs (more like interrupt rather than polling). It's a way for different applications to communicate with each other seamlessly to enable automation of processes. 

1. Event occurs: this can be any predefined action or occurence within an app. For eg. new user sign up, payment completed, file upload etc.
2. HTTP callback: when the event occurs, the application that hosts the webhook generates an HTTP request containing information about the event (payload). This HTTP request is sent to a URL specified by the other application which is listening for incoming data.
3. Receiving application: this is set up to listen to incoming webhooks, receives the HTTP request containing the event data. It processes the data and performs specific actions based on the received information. 

Examples/ Use cases include: Real Time notifications (in social media), automated data sync (updating information in a CRM when a new order is placed in an e-commerce platform), integration between services or event driven automation (in our example, snyk scanning occurs on each pull request)
